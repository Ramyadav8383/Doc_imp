# What is web3 ? what are the types and why web3 is now in trending?

Basically web3 is the next generation of the internet where we are utilizing blockchain technology and decentralization tools,eg: ethereum, solana, polygon etc. In web 2.0 you were the product as you were browsing social netrworks but in web 3.0 some belives that you will be the owner of your content, the content or the stuff that you are posted online, so if you want a post to stay up it will stay up but if you want to take it down they say in web 3.0

# what is HTTP and HTTPS

An HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. The HTTP protocol provides communication between different communication systems. When the user makes an HTTP request on the browser, then the webserver sends the requested data to the user in the form of web pages. In short, we can say that the HTTP protocol allows us to transfer the data from the server to the client.

An HTTP is an application layer protocol that comes above the TCP layer. It has provided some standard rules to the web browsers and servers, which they can use to communicate with each other.

An HTTP is a stateless protocol as each transaction is executed separately without having any knowledge of the previous transactions, which means that once the transaction is completed between the web browser and the server, the connection gets lost.

What is HTTPS?
The full form of HTTPS is Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. The HTTP protocol does not provide the security of the data, while HTTP ensures the security of the data. Therefore, we can say that HTTPS is a secure version of the HTTP protocol. This protocol allows transferring the data in an encrypted form. The use of HTTPS protocol is mainly required where we need to enter the bank account details. The HTTPS protocol is mainly used where we require to enter the login credentials. In modern browsers such as chrome, both the protocols, i.e., HTTP and HTTPS, are marked differently. To provide encryption, HTTPS uses an encryption protocol known as Transport Layer Security, and officially, it is referred to as a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This protocol uses a mechanism known as asymmetric public key infrastructure, and it uses two different keys which are given below:

Private key: This key is available on the web server, which is managed by the owner of a website.
It decrypts the information which is encrypted by the public key.
Public key: This key is available to everyone. It converts the data into an encrypted form.

Main difference between the HTTP and HTTPS

The major difference between the HTTP and HTTPS is the SSL certificate. The HTTPS protocol is an extended version of the HTTP protocol with an additional feature of security.

This additional feature of security is very important for those websites which transmit sensitive data such as credit card information.

HTTP vs HTTPS
The HTTPS protocol is secured due to the SSL protocol. The SSL protocol encrypts the data which the client transmits to the server. If someone tries to steal the information which is being communicated between the client and the server, then he/she would not be able to understand due to the encryption. This is the main difference between the HTTP and HTTPS that the HTTP does not contain SSL, whereas the HTTPS contains SSL that provides secure communication between the client and the server.

Which is better, HTTP or HTTPS?
Till now, we read that the HTTPS is better than HTTP because it provides security. Sometimes our website does not contain an e-commerce page that requires sensitive data; in that case, we can switch to the HTTP protocol. Despite the security, HTTPS also provides SEO. So, we do need to put more effort into boosting our SEO.

HTTP vs HTTPS performance
The speed of HTTP is faster than the HTTPS as the HTTPS contains SSL protocol, while HTTPS does not contain an SSL protocol. This additional feature of SSL in HTTPS makes the page loading slower.

# what is DNS and how its works?

The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. When users type domain names such as ‘google.com’ or ‘nytimes.com’ into web browsers, DNS is responsible for finding the correct IP address for those sites. Browsers then use those addresses to communicate with origin servers or CDN edge servers to access website information.

How do DNS servers resolve a DNS query?
In a typical DNS query without any caching, there are four servers that work together to deliver an IP address to the client: recursive resolvers, root nameservers, TLD nameservers, and authoritative nameservers.

The DNS recursor (also referred to as the DNS resolver) is a server that receives the query from the DNS client, and then interacts with other DNS servers to hunt down the correct IP. Once the resolver receives the request from the client, the resolver then actually behaves as a client itself, querying the other three types of DNS servers in search of the right IP.

The Internet’s DNS system works much like a phone book by managing the mapping between names and numbers. DNS servers translate requests for names into IP addresses, controlling which server an end user will reach when they type a domain name into their web browser. These requests are called queries.
DNS, or the Domain Name System, translates human readable domain names (for example, www.amazon.com) to machine readable IP addresses (for example, 192.0.2.44).

Types of DNS Service
Authoritative DNS: An authoritative DNS service provides an update mechanism that developers use to manage their public DNS names. It then answers DNS queries, translating domain names into IP address so computers can communicate with each other. Authoritative DNS has the final authority over a domain and is responsible for providing answers to recursive DNS servers with the IP address information. Amazon Route 53 is an authoritative DNS system.

Recursive DNS: Clients typically do not make queries directly to authoritative DNS services. Instead, they generally connect to another type of DNS service known a resolver, or a recursive DNS service. A recursive DNS service acts like a hotel concierge: while it doesn't own any DNS records, it acts as an intermediary who can get the DNS information on your behalf. If a recursive DNS has the DNS reference cached, or stored for a period of time, then it answers the DNS query by providing the source or IP information. If not, it passes the query to one or more authoritative DNS servers to find the information.

# What is domain Name? how it works

In simplest terms a domain name is just the address to your website so think of the internet as a vast map full of avenues and streets and turns everywhere and think of your website as your house in order for anyone to find their way to your house even you you will need an address this address is your domain name every website has an ip and an ip is just a seemingly random string of numbers. so when you register and purchase a domain name its almost like saving your home address as home into your phone.it gives that ip address a simple easy to remember name that anyone can type in and get to your website this is because it would be really difficult to remember a random string of numbers every time. you wanna go to apple.com or amazon.com or whatever it may be let's say create a dummywebsite.com you can remember that rather than 66.134.299. so let's say that you type in create a dummywebsite.com whenever you hit enter your computer sends a request to a bunch of servers that make up the dns and its stands domain name system this domain name system looks up the
correct ip address and just points your computer into the right direction all within less than a millisecond.

# what is hosting and explain different type of hosting.

Web Hosting is a service that allows hosting/post-web-server applications( website or web page ) on a computer system through which web-browser clients can have easy access to electronic content on the Internet.

Web Server or Web Host is a computer system that provide web hosting. When Internet user’s want to view your website, all they need to do is type your website address or domain into their browser. The user’s computer will then connect to your server and your web pages will be delivered to them through the browser. Basically, the web hosts allow the customers to place documents, such as HTML pages, graphics, and other multimedia files, etc. onto a special type of computer called a web server. It provides a constant and high-speed connection to the backbone of the Internet.

Different types of Web hosting services are listed below:

1.Free Hosting
